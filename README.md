# Perfect State Transfer on GCD-Graphs

This Git repository contains the code we developed to generate data and conduct experiments on perfect state transfer in GCD-graphs over a **local** Frobenius ring, as discussed in our paper:

**[1]** Tung T. Nguyen, Nguyen Duy Tan, *Perfect State Transfer on GCD-Graphs over a Finite Frobenius Ring, I: General Theory and Results for Local Rings* (preprint, 2025).

There are two files, each dealing with local Frobenius rings of a different type. We refer the readers to the individual files for precise descriptions of their functionality:

1. A file on perfect state transfer (PST) in GCD-graphs over quotients of polynomial rings.
   
2. A file on PST in GCD-graphs over quotients of the ring $\mathbb{Z}/n[x]$.

The reason we have two different files is that in the case of polynomial rings, we can't figure out a direct way to iterate over a ring even if it is finite. We have to use an indirect method, via the theory of Gr√∂bner bases, to deal with this (thanks to the help of Dr. Ricardo Buring). We are grateful for his kind help over the years.

## Description

Our code utilizes the SageMath 9.4 kernel and the Python library NetworkX.
